The Javascript Code Quiz

I was tasked with making a A quiz by using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

It needs the following:

1. WHEN the user clicks on the start button a timer starts and the user is presented with a question.

2. When the user answers a question they are presented with another question.

3. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

4. When the user has answered all questions or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.

5. When the quiz has ended the user can save their initials and their score and have results in a high scores table.

6. Option to replay the quiz or, clear highscores.
